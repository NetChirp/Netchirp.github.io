            I'm a web development student interested in learning beyond just web development. My main areas of focus
            include the web, operating systems (understanding and administering them rather than coding them), computer
            networking, and desktop or command-line software development, which typically requires a deeper level of
            technical knowledge than JavaScript-based web applications.
